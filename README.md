# Home System Project

Standalone full-stack application with Java based server and Android client
Easy configurable via single xml file
Preferable environment: Linux, Windows is also supported but network features are unstable

### Server purposes

* Take care about your IP cameras: monitor motions, upload to Cloud and notify the Clients ASAP, reboot if Camera has stuck
* Watch for your ISP failures and notify once Internet is back
* Run custom scripts on events ag. armed, disarmed, ISP changed, server started, server stopped
* Watch for your network devices, change state (arm/disarm) based on presence of the well known devices aka Master-devices
* Send you an hourly report with cameras snapshots, detailed report and any data you want to know via custom scripts

### How to setup the Server

* Copy the tar archive to the Server machine you like
* Extract contents into a separate folder
* _(OS dependent) Make scripts under bin dir executable if you are on the Linux_
* Modify the **conf/system-settings_sample.xml** as you wish and place it as **conf/system-settings.xml**
* Run bin/start.* _(OS dependent)_
* Pair Client(s)

# Requirements
* Standalone x86/ARM PC
* 1GB of RAM
* Email account
* Some drive space to keep the videos and app (~60GB can keep tons of fragments)
* Internet
* Web Cams (Vstarcam tested)

# NOTES
- Normally ARM can process 1 cam per core and x86 2 cams per core (monitoring and recording)
- Personally I'm using Intel NUC based on Intel Celeron J3455 and 4GB of RAM
- If you need to add/change features fill free to contact me
- If you found any bug enable verbose logging on an any Client, try to reproduce and contact me
